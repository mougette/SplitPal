# SplitPal

How to Run:
Assuming you have a proper react native environment, you can run our application with expo (like the Spike Exercise).
Clone the Project from the Iteration-1 branch at the repo link
https://github.com/mougette/SplitPal
Afterwards ensure all dependencies and node modules are installed with
npm install
Now, run the application with:
npm start.
You can then use a mobile emulator or a mobile device with the expo app and scan the QR code in the web browser pop-up or command line.
